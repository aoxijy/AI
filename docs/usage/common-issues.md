# Common Issues

## Function Abnormalities

### Reasoning content (chain of thought) is not displayed when using deepseek-reasoner

**Possible reasons**:

- Make sure that the DeepSeek service provider is configured, and the service provider type is set to DeepSeek instead of OpenAI. Because the original OpenAI format does not have reasoning content.
- Make sure that the service provider you are using will return reasoning content. DeepSeek official and Silicon Flow support it, but some third-party service providers will not return reasoning content.

### The configured service provider is not working/the reply is empty

- Make sure that the service provider type, API address, and API Key are filled in correctly.
- Remember to add v1 to the end of the API address. For example, `https://api.xxxai.com/v1` instead of `https://api.xxxai.com`.

### Linux Client Fails to Launch with Error: KMS: DRM_IOCTL_MODE_CREATE_DUMB failed: Permission denied

This appears to be related to an issue with Webkitgtk + Nvidia drivers. Try setting the environment variable `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` before launching. See [Issue #49](https://github.com/NitroRCr/AIaW/issues/49)
