# Cross-Platform

AIaW is cross-platform, and we provide local clients for different platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac OS, and Android), as well as a web version (PWA).

The local client can be downloaded from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/NitroRCr/AIaW/releases/latest), and the web version can be accessed at [aiaw.app](https://aiaw.app) or [self-deployed](/self-host/).

Most features are available on all platforms. Compared with the web version, the local client avoids the limitations of cross-domain API calls (applicable to a few service providers that do not allow cross-domain calls). In addition, the desktop version (Win, Linux, Mac) adds support for STDIO type [MCP plugins](mcp).

## Web Version

Thanks to the responsive interface design, the web version adapts to screens of different sizes and proportions. You can use it on different devices such as mobile phones and computers through a browser.

### Browser Compatibility

For good compatibility and user experience, it is recommended to use a browser based on a newer version of the Chromium kernel (Chrome, new Edge, etc.)

### PWA Installation

The web version is also a [PWA application](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) (Progressive Web Application). PWA can be installed directly, and a shortcut will be created on the desktop or "Start" after installation. The application will be opened from a separate window through the shortcut.

In this way, PWA achieves the same convenience and user experience as local applications, and also supports offline browsing, while retaining the advantages of web pages such as hot updates and lightweight.

The installation button is usually on the right side of the address bar (PC) or in the browser menu (mobile phone)
