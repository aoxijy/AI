# Share Link

You can automatically set the service provider via a link. Here's an example link for OpenAI:

```
https://aiaw.app/set-provider?provider={"type":"openai","settings":{"apiKey":"{key}","baseURL":"{address}/v1","compatibility":"strict"}}
```

For other service providers, you can refer to the sharing link format in the settings.
