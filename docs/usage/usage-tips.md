# Usage Tips

## Pasting Large Text Blocks

When pasting text using Ctrl + V **outside the text box**, the text will be added as an attachment to the input. Text pasted in this way will not occupy display space.

## Creating Conversations on Mobile

On mobile devices, you can quickly create a new conversation by long-pressing the icon in the top right corner. (This feature is currently not supported in Safari browser due to compatibility issues.)
